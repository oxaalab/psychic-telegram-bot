# Code of Conduct

We are committed to a welcoming, harassment‑free experience for everyone.

- Be respectful and inclusive.
- Assume good faith; disagree constructively.
- No harassment, trolling, or doxxing.
- Follow maintainers’ guidance.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported privately to the maintainers. Consequences may include warnings up
to temporary or permanent exclusion from the project spaces.

This policy is inspired by the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).
